## Example #1

I've been lying to my girlfriend. Since we began dating I've been telling her I don't make a lot of money. I can afford our dates, and have no issue paying for everyday life, but I'm not wealthy. I have been keeping a secret, and I actually do have a large amount of money. How should I expect her to feel when I tell her this information. Keep your answer short and to the point.
